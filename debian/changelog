  * Team upload.
  * New upstream release.
  * d/patches/de-vendorize.patch: Refreshed.
  * d/patches/use-venv-wheels.patch:
    - When inside a virtual environment, prepend to sys.path any wheels found
      in <venv>/lib/python-wheels
    - Adjust setup.py's test_requires since python-virtualenv is enough to
      satisfy the requirement, but the tools aren't smart enough to know this.
  * d/compat: Bump to version 8.
  * d/control:
    - Add python-pip-whl binary package.
    - Add to Build-Depends: python{,3}-mock, python{,3}-test,
      python{,3}-scripttest, python-virtualenv, python3-wheel
    - Update other Build-Depends.

python-pip (1.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * New upstream release.
  * d/patches:
    - system-ca-certificates.patch: Removed.  This is obsoleted by the
      vendorizing (and on Debian, de-vendorizing) of the requests library.
    - no-python-specific-scripts.patch: Removed.  Upstream renamed pip-X.Y
      to pipX.Y but adopts our pipX name as well.  I don't think it hurts
      to also have pipX.Y.
    - de-vendorize.patch: Added, in order to use Debian packages instead
      of vendorized packages.
  * d/control:
    - Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5 with no other changes needed.
    - Update Depends for the vendorized packages.
  * d/python{,3}-pip.pyremove: Remove pip/_vendor directory from binary
    packages.

      default usage of pip will just error with an informative message
      telling you to install ca-certificates anyway.  (Closes: #722295)
    - wrap-and-sort
  * d/python{,3}-pip.install: wrap-and-sort
